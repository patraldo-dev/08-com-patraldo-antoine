The First Frame shows a photo of an engraving in which a skeletal human-like figure plays the fiddle as he dances.  He is accompanied by a skeletal dog and a skeletal cat.  As is the tradition in Mexican Day of the Dead celebrations, the path on which they are dancing leads to a the head of a macabre figure partially visible in the background.  The macabre figure has curved ample wide curved spikes for hair.  Animate the figures, having the fiddler dance and the dog and cat dance, and the macabre figure in the background shake his  mane, smile, and wink his eye.
