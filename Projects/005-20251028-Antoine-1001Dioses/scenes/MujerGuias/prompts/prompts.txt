The First Frame is a photo of a colorful hand-drawn female figure whose features - eyes, nose and mouth are clearly visible.  She has ears, eyes, a nose and plump limps.  It looks as if she has slender, fine vines tearing from her eyes and coming out of her nose and ears. She has  just made eye contact with the audience (not visible to us) and maintains bemused eye contact with the viewer as she moves her head naturally and blinks her eyes, as if in a conversation with the audience.  The features of her face are animated as she begins a silent, whispered monologue. Cinematic, haunting, subtle motion, film grain - the audience views her from the same distance the whole time and her features are not enhanced in any way.
