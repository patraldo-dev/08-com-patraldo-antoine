Sin inspiratción:  A green alien king steps forward to introduce himself.  He raises his arms and takes a bow, then steps back.  He does not exit but stands tall, looking from one side to the other while enjoying the adulation of the crowd -- not in the scene.  The planet system behind him, in the upper right-hand corner is all the while pulsating, the planet itself changing color as its moons rotate around it in a counter-clockwise fashion. 


Modified:  A green alien king steps forward to introduce himself.  He has arms like a human and green spikey things sticking out from his back.  He raises his arms  and takes a bow, then steps back.  He does not exit but stands tall, looking from one side to the other while enjoying the adulation of the crowd -- not in the scene.  The planet system behind him, in the upper right-hand corner is all the while pulsating ever so subtly, the planet itself changing color as its moons rotate around it in a counter-clockwise fashion. 

One of five alien kings steps forward to introduce himself.  He raises his arms and takes a bow, then steps back.  One of the geological cauldrons next to him burbs lava and belches a bit of smoke.


Updated Blue King prompt:  
One of five alien kings steps forward to introduce himself.  He raises his arms and takes a bow, then steps back.  One of the two geological cauldrons next to him burbs lava and belches a bit of smoke.  The other geological crater does the same.  The rotary blades of the spaceship behind him are spinning, and the windows of the spaceship should light-up in a sequential pattern, as if going around in a circle.


Original (sin inspiracion): A humanoid figure with horns on his head  steps forward to introduce himself.  He raises his arms and takes a bow, then steps back.  He does not exit but stands tall, looking from one side to the other while enjoying the adulation of the crowd -- not in the scene.  The planet in the background above him glows vibrantly, varying in intensity.  The stalagmites which surround the figure oscillate and undulate subtly.
