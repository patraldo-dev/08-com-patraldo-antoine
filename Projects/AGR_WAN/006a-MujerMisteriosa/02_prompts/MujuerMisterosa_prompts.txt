The hand-drawn colorful face of a woman is seen an apparition projected against a white wall in the First Frame.  Her face is a projection illuminated in a mystical, ethereal light but her features - eyes, nose and mouth and dangling earrings are clearly visible even though there are some plants and other objects in the foreground.  She has just made eye contact with the audience (not visible to us) and maintains bemused  eye contact with the viewer as she moves her head naturally, as if in a conversation with the audience.  The features of her face are animated as she begins a silent, whispered monologue. Cinematic, haunting, subtle motion, film grain - the audience views her from the same distance the whole time and her features are not enhanced in any way.
