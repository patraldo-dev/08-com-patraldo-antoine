The First Frame is a photo of a colorful hand-drawn female figure whose features - eyes, nose and mouth are clearly visible.  Her head is adorned by a headdress made of long stems each termininating in spherical balls.  Dangling earrings and a necklace compliment her headdress which sways slightly with the movement of her head.  She has  just made eye contact with the audience (not visible to us) and maintains bemused  eye contact with the viewer as she moves her head naturally, as if in a conversation with the audience.  The features of her face are animated as she begins a silent, whispered monologue. Cinematic, haunting, subtle motion, film grain - the audience views her from the same distance the whole time and her features are not enhanced in any way.
